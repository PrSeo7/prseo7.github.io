# Tabata Timer Privacy Policy

_Last updated: 2025-11-09_

Tabata Timer (the “App”) is provided by PrSeo7 (“we”, “us”, or “our”). We value your privacy and want you to understand how we handle your information when you use the App on iOS or Android devices. This policy describes what data we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have. The App does not require you to create an account, and we do not knowingly collect information that can directly identify you.

---

## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Data you provide locally
- **Interval settings and preferences** (e.g., preparation/work/rest durations, beep toggle) are stored only on your device using the operating system’s secure storage (SharedPreferences on Android / NSUserDefaults on iOS). We cannot access this data.

### 1.2 Automatically collected diagnostic data
- **Usage analytics**: When you grant consent, Firebase Analytics records anonymous events such as button taps, screen views, and device coarse information (model, OS version, locale) to help us understand which features are most helpful.
- **Crash reports**: Firebase Crashlytics collects stack traces, anonymized device identifiers, OS version, and the state of the app when a crash occurs so we can fix stability issues quickly.

### 1.3 Advertising data
- The App uses **Google Mobile Ads (AdMob)** to show banner and interstitial ads after an initial ad-free period. AdMob may collect device identifiers (e.g., Advertising ID or IDFA), IP address, coarse location, language, and interaction data to deliver and measure ads. When you are in Firebase Test Lab or running a debug build, we force Google’s test ads.
- On iOS, we request App Tracking Transparency permission before accessing the IDFA. If you decline, AdMob serves non‑personalized ads.

### 1.4 Device permissions
- **Tracking permission (iOS)**: Requested only to determine whether personalized ads can be shown. The App still works if you deny it.
- **Audio playback & wakelock**: Used to play countdown beeps and keep the screen awake during a workout. No audio recordings or motion data are collected.

We do not collect contact lists, precise location, health data, or payment information.

## 2. How We Use Information

We use the data described above to:
1. Provide core Tabata timer functionality (store your configuration locally).
2. Improve performance, reliability, and user experience through aggregated analytics.
3. Diagnose and fix crashes or bugs.
4. Show ads that fund future development and keep the App free.
5. Comply with legal obligations and enforce our terms.

We never sell your personal data.

---

## 3. Sharing With Third Parties

We share data only with service providers that help us operate the App:
- **Google/Firebase** (Firebase Analytics, Firebase Crashlytics, Google Mobile Ads) – analytics, crash diagnostics, and advertising.
- **Apple / Google** (App Store, Google Play) – to distribute the App and process crash metadata supplied by the OS.

Each provider processes data under its own terms and privacy policies. We may also disclose data if required by law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of our users or the public.

---

## 4. Data Retention

- Local settings remain on your device until you uninstall the App or reset it from your operating system settings.
- Analytics and crash logs are retained by Firebase for the period necessary to analyze trends (generally up to 26 months, subject to Google’s policies).
- AdMob retains advertising data according to Google’s policies.

You can request deletion of Firebase-linked data by contacting us; we will work with Google to remove the information when feasible.

---

## 5. Your Choices & Rights

- **Opt out of analytics**: Disable “Share Analytics” in your device settings (iOS) or reset the advertising ID / limit ad tracking (Android & iOS). You may also uninstall the App.
- **App Tracking Transparency**: On iOS you can deny or revoke permission at any time in Settings ▸ Privacy & Security ▸ Tracking.
- **Reset local data**: Clear the App’s storage/cache or reinstall it to remove saved intervals and preferences.
- **Advertising controls**: Use the platform controls to opt out of personalized ads. AdMob will still deliver contextual ads.

Residents of the EEA, UK, California, and other regions with data-protection laws may have additional rights (access, correction, deletion, objection, portability). Contact us to exercise these rights; we may request information to verify your identity before acting on your request.

---

## 6. Children’s Privacy

Tabata Timer is designed for general fitness users and is not directed to children under 13 (or the relevant minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided us data, please contact us so we can delete it.

---

## 7. International Transfers

We operate from the Republic of Korea and may process data on servers located in other countries (e.g., the United States, Singapore, or EU regions operated by Google). These locations may have privacy laws different from yours. We rely on standard contractual clauses or comparable safeguards offered by our service providers to protect your information during transfers.

---

## 8. Security

We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the data we control. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security. Please use the App responsibly and keep your device up to date.

---

## 9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect new features, legal requirements, or service providers. We will change the “Last updated” date above and may provide in-app notices for material changes. Your continued use after changes means you accept the updated policy.
